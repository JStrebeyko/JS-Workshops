                when babbled out by someone this frail, unconsistent and craving as me. What does

            Someone who does not inspire me in any way, someone who I know is feeding upon the dying,
            someone with no spine (just like me), concerned only with own well-being. It's no <i>love</i>
             you confess, it'd be the <i>weakness</i> - the <i>necessity</i> of being someone's property.">you</span>
